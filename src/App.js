          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm Sepehr, a full-stack software engineer and web developer based in San Francisco Bay Area, CA.</p>
          <p>I love tech and have been a tech-enthusiast since 7 years ago, and recently I decided to roll up my sleeves and be the builder of the things that have always interested me. During the past 4 years, I've founded and worked for different startups in various positions, which allowed me to meet many nice talented people and entrepreneurs.</p>
          <p>I have worked with a lot of popular software programs before becoming a developer and one of the most valuable skills I've learned from my past journey, is how to find high-quality resources and link myself to appropriate people to learn new skills. I recognize myself as a fast-learner, and you don't have to take my word for it! I was well-known at my university for my well-rounded research and presentation on various subjects. Plus, here's how my previous employer describes me in my recommendation letter:</p>
          <blockquote>
            We think that Sepehr has a high speed in learning programming concepts.

          </blockquote>
          <p>As a software engineer, I enjoy using my skills to make innovative things that solve real-world problems and I love to bridge the gap between engineering and design.</p>
          <p>When I'm not working, I either watch YouTube for fun or to expand my knowledge, play with the UI/UX of other apps and try to come up with my twist on their concept, or sometimes play video games :)</p>
